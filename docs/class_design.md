# Class Architecture

This project is split into (add number here) different classes

## Budget Class

This class uses functions ```categorize_transaction``` and ```format_currency``` to keep track of expenses and make sure they align with the budget set in place.

## Analyze Spending

This class uses functions ```calculate_average_spending``` and ```analyze_spending_trends``` to use average and trends to provide an analysis on the users spending.

## Transactions

This class uses functions ```parse_date```, ```categorize_transaction```, and ```format_currency``` to make spending appear as transactions while being formatted correctly.
